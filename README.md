## Helloü§ò

This is a repo of mine in which I usually experiment js codes and then after completing I push them to a new repo. You can check out my current projects here

Right now this repo is consisting of
- **Neomorphic fully functional Caluclator**. [See the live deployment here](https://srikant-code.github.io/My-Front-End-Codes/Javascript%20projects/Calculator/calculator.html)  
Here is a preview of the Calculator I built.
